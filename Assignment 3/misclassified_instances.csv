"Hi Kris, I've had a similar reaction. Slightly sore arm after 1st Moderna vaccine so I thought if this is it I'm home free till the second when I was sick with a severe head and neck ache, 102 fever, body aches and chills. I was so miserable I couldn't even sleep it off. Ok I thought, I can gut through 2 days of anything just wish I had gotten the memo that probably should have taken PTO the day after the second vaccine. Then after day 3 until day 9 I felt like my body was supercharged, with tons of energy. I felt amazing. I joked with people that my body still thought the virus was present so my immune system was going crazy. The only side effect I had was a huge sore lump/lymph node, about the size of a large marble, in my arm pit of the same arm where I got the shot. Then day 10 came and it was one of the scariest experiences with my body I have ever had...it wasn't gradual, it was like this huge wave of dizziness came over me walking into work. I struggled to think or concentrate and I could barely walk straight. I was walking down the hall and my body literally veered into the wall. My blood pressure was elevated, and my doctor commented about my rapid heart rate, I'm guessing most likely because of the fight or flight mode I was in with the way I was feeling but who knows. After a few days I went on prednisone and things got a little better either because of or perhaps in spite of the steroid. I also developed tinnitus which is so annoying. For about two weeks it was pretty rough and my doctor didn't know what was causing it..talked about an MRI $$$$. Now two months later it's either a bit better or I have learned to adapt but I'm concerned it's permanent. It comes and goes in waves and visual stimuli like scrolling on my computer at work exacerbate it. I feel like I have become a Covid vaccine long-hauler. I know several other people, including my sister that this has happened to after the vaccine so I am wondering if this is a triggered response in susceptible people. I've heard talk of a Covid booster in our future and this terrifies me. Especially if the vaccine is mandated for work and travel.",0,1

A vaccine that is supposed to be developed over numerous years are now developed within a few months will never be as safe as there will be insufficient time provided to monitor longer term side effects of vaccine and accurately compare with placebo (given injection but without actual vaccine but only glucose sugar water). Quickly vaccinating the population just to pick up economy is never a good idea unless the vaccine is absolutely safe through long term testing. I hope the safety of the citizens are placed priority! A weak trait of most Singaporean is kiasu and therefore easily pushed into vaccinating simply by seeing news like vaccination running out or first come first serve.

"Yeah, I‚Äôm not sure about the vaccine. I‚Äòm immunocompromised, a former cancer survivor since 20 with many years of chemo throughout my twenties and thirties. I also suffered a stroke this past January from (told anyway) damage inflicted on an artery from radiation done in my mid twenties. Anyways, point is, I‚Äôm not in the best of health. I got vaccinated (Pfizer) back in April, second shot in May. Soon after my first shot, I began to develop a dry, unproductive hacking cough and strange feeling in lungs, as if I had pneumonia. This was a nuisance, but I didn‚Äôt pay it much mind. After my second shot, I began to develop sickly spells in my entire body, waves of sickness that are akin to sea sickness or food poisoning in their manifestations. A burning, infectious feeling through my body that is always present, but can worsen to hellish degrees, leaving me in misery. Crying over the toilet, vomiting and diarrhea, then going away over a period of minutes. It can be absolute misery, yet is unlike any illness I‚Äôve ever had. Since May, I have been in the ER three times, seven primary, three walk in visits, two specialists, and a week in a mental hospital from suicidal ideation from being so miserable. Yet all doctors have no clue what is going on. All my bloodwork is fine, lung scans are clear. Only thing that has shown up in my labs is an elevated sedimentation rate and positive rheumatoid factor, non-specific indicators of inflammation. Yet whatever this is, it often leaves me bedridden and has been a marked decrease in my QoL. I‚Äòm not an anti-vaxxer. I believe in the science, I trust the medical community. But, I cannot shake the coincidence of timing of when this obscure illness began to when I got my first shot, and how it became significantly worse after my second. This is purely conjecture on my part, but I suspect I‚Äôve had some exceptionally rare adverse reaction to the vaccine. Maybe it‚Äôs triggered something, like Lupus? I can think of no other cause. Don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting this, maybe in the hope someone knows something. I‚Äôm planning on a last resort to Mayo but am not optimistic they will find anything. This is flying under all screening, yet leaving me in misery. I wish I hadn‚Äôt gotten the shot.",0,1

"The only real evidence you provided was for the reported case. And it was literally called the first ever. You provide no evidence or links to support the rest of you claims. No studies, no research, and no data. You are making claims but no backing them up. Here is some data about cases of disease before and after the vaccines were created https://ivaccinate.org/about-vaccines/vaccines-are-effective/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=ivaccinate Another http://www.immunizeforgood.com/fact-or-fiction/benefits-vs.-risks Risks of not vaccinating https://www.caringforkids.cps.ca/handouts/when-parents-choose-not-to-vaccinate-risks-and-responsibilities The reason vaccines have risks is because a) the person may have an undiagnosed immune disorder. Which means they can't take vaccines because their immune system can't handle it. Or. B) they may have an unknown allergy to an ingredient or chemical causing a bad reaction. The risks are less because of vaccines themselves and more so due to the individuals body. If a persons body cannot handle the vaccine obviously there is going to be a reaction. There is also the fact to consider that it is not always the fault of the vaccine and rather it might be something else entirely. Correlation is not causation. Once again no evidence of the claims you are making about the cases of harm vaccines have caused. Which arguably make vaccines even MORE important. Those who can't vaccinate need to rely on herd immune so they are at less risk of these diseaes. Once again the cases of vaccines harming people are VASTLY outweighed by those who are vaccinated and perfectly fine. The vast majority of the people who are vaccinating experience no side effects or harm. Further showing that it a matter of the individuals and not the vaccine. 85% of children GLOBALLY are vaccinated https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination That's just the children. Out of over 300 millions people in the u.s. roughly 80-90 percent are vaccinated. Again where are your sources? You make these claims about how many cases there are per year yet give no evidence to it. Yes before the vaccine for measles was created people died or were harmed by the measles. Which just proves my point. Those cases started declining AFTER the vaccine was created. Meaning you SHOULD vaccinate. They created it and improved and eventually most younger people in the u.s. have never even heard of the measles. Nowadays though the rates are rising again due to people deciding not to vaccinate. You're the data does speak for itself. It's saying people should vaccinate.",0,1

There is absolutely no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic. I've never heard so much nonsense talked about vaccines. You do not vaccinate people who are not at risk from a disease.

Invariably mutation causes infection rate increase and lethality rate decrease. Vaccination at this stage, is essentially pointless.",0,1

So yes there is some uncertainty. Of course there is. You‚Äôll probably feel like shit for a few days, headache and muscle ache.

"Let‚Äôs make sure we are clear‚Ä¶ This is not a vaccine. They are using the term ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù to sneak this thing under public health exemptions. This is not a vaccine. This is mRNA packaged in a fat envelope that is delivered to a cell. It is a medical device designed to stimulate the human cell into becoming a pathogen creator. It is not a vaccine. Vaccines actually are a legally defined term under public health law; they are a legally defined term under CDC and FDA standards.[1] And the vaccine specifically has to stimulate both the immunity within the person receiving it and it also has to disrupt transmission. And that is not what this is. They (Moderna and Pfizer) have been abundantly clear in saying that the mRNA strand that is going into the cell is not to stop the transmission, it is a treatment. But if it was discussed as a treatment, it would not get the sympathetic ear of public health authorities because then people would say, ‚ÄúWhat other treatments are there? The use of the term vaccine is unconscionable for both the legal definition and also it is actually the sucker punch to open and free discourse‚Ä¶ Moderna was started as a chemotherapy company for cancer, not a vaccine manufacturer for SARSCOV2. If we said we are going to give people prophylactic chemotherapy for the cancer they don‚Äôt yet have, we‚Äôd be laughed out of the room because it‚Äôs a stupid idea. That‚Äôs exactly what this is. This is a mechanical device in the form of a very small package of technology that is being inserted into the human system to activate the cell to become a pathogen manufacturing site. And I refuse to stipulate in any conversations that this is in fact a vaccine issue. The only reason why the term is being used is to abuse the 1905 Jacobson case that has been misrepresented since it was written. And if we were honest with this, we would actually call it what it is: it is a chemical pathogen device that is actually meant to unleash a chemical pathogen production action within a cell. It is a medical device, not a drug because it meets the CDRH definition of a device. It is not a living system, it is not a biologic system, it is a physical technology - it happens to just come in the size of a molecular package. So, we need to be really clear on making sure we don‚Äôt fall for their game. Because their game is if we talk about it as a vaccine then we are going to get into a vaccine conversation but this is not, by their own admission, a vaccine. As a result it must be clear to everyone listening that we will not fall for this failed definition just like we will not fall for their industrial chemical definition of health. Both of them are functionally flawed and are an implicit violation of the legal construct that is being exploited. I get frustrated when I hear activists and lawyers say, ‚Äúwe are going to fight the vaccine‚Äù. If you stipulate it‚Äôs a vaccine you‚Äôve already lost the battle. It‚Äôs not a vaccine. It is made to make you sick. 80% of the people exposed to SARSCOV2 are asymptomatic carriers. 80% of people who get this injected into them experience a clinical adverse event. You are getting injected with a chemical substance to induce illness, not to induce an immuno-transmissive response. In other words, nothing about this is going to stop you from transmitting anything. This is about getting you sick and having your own cells be the thing that get you sick. When the paymaster for the distribution of information happens to be the industry that‚Äôs doing the distributing, we lose. Because the only narrative is the one that will be compensated by the people writing the check. That goes for our politicians‚Ä¶ and our media - it has been paid for - if you follow the money you realize there is no non-conflicted voice on any network."" - Dr. David Martin, Jan 5th 2021.",0,1

"I can totally relate to the crying. For days I have been doing a good bit of that. At first people insinuated it was psychological even though I've never been an anti-vaxxer. I willingly lined up to take it. But now that my husband had a bout of it also, but very briefly after 2nd dose, he believes me. I just can't understand why this isn't being covered. Some days I can barely function and it seems like it's that way for you too. Even though I have exercise induced asthma when I exercise outdoors during the cold, I'm healthy. I go for my wellness exam, mammogram, dermatologist, and ophthalmologist each year and rarely have to go for visits other than those. My doctor told me she wishes all her patients were like me. She told me she's had several patients who are calling with these symptoms also. I just hope and pray for you and all the others that these side effects disappear and we can get back to normal. Honestly, I wish I had not taken it at all. But with the pressure for vaccine passports to be able to travel and just to go to store mounting, I took it as well as the 2nd although I'm not sure why, if someone is vaccinated, they care if I am or not.
